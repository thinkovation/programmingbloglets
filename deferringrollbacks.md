# Golang: Deferring Transaction Rollback
I had an interesting moment today, I askedd ChatGPT to create a function that would delete some records and then insert new ones as part of a transaction. With my "prompting-Fu" turned to max, it did a fair job of generating some useful code:
```
func insertBatch(userID, auditID int, batch []responseEntry) error {
	// Begin a new transaction
	tx, err := db.DB.Begin()
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to start transaction: %w", err)
	}

	// Defer rollback in case of failure
	defer func() {
		if p := recover(); p != nil {
			_ = tx.Rollback()
			panic(p) // Re-throw panic after rollback
		} else if err != nil {
			_ = tx.Rollback()
		}
	}()

	// Step 1: Delete existing records by audit_id and questionIDs
	questionIDs := []int{}
	for _, e := range batch {
		questionIDs = append(questionIDs, e.questionID)
	}

	deleteQuery := "DELETE FROM responses WHERE audit_id = $1 AND questionID = ANY($2)"
	_, err = tx.Exec(deleteQuery, auditID, pq.Array(questionIDs))
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to delete records: %w", err)
	}

	// Step 2: Insert new batch of records
	// Construct the base query
	insertQuery := "INSERT INTO responses (user_id, audit_id, questionID, response) VALUES "

	// Prepare placeholders and values
	placeholders := []string{}
	values := []interface{}{}
	paramIndex := 1
	for _, e := range batch {
		placeholders = append(placeholders, fmt.Sprintf("($%d, $%d, $%d, $%d)", paramIndex, paramIndex+1, paramIndex+2, paramIndex+3))
		values = append(values, userID, auditID, e.questionID, e.response)
		paramIndex += 4
	}

	// Combine query and placeholders
	insertQuery += strings.Join(placeholders, ",")
	insertQuery += " ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING"

	// Execute the insert query
	_, err = tx.Exec(insertQuery, values...)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to execute batch insert: %w", err)
	}

	// Commit the transaction
	if err := tx.Commit(); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to commit transaction: %w", err)
	}

	return nil
}

```

I like the approach to batching (although I did prompt for that) but the thing that gave me pause was the deferred function to perform a Rollback of the transaction in the event of a panic, or the function returning an error - This bit:
```
// Defer rollback in case of failure
	defer func() {
		if p := recover(); p != nil {
			_ = tx.Rollback()
			panic(p) // Re-throw panic after rollback
		} else if err != nil {
			_ = tx.Rollback()
		}
	}()
```

While undoubtedly this appears correct, I was bothered that it didn't feel very idiomatic - Idiomatically we handle errors immediately, we don't like cascading unless we have to. Plus - I am somewhat of the view  (and this is ideological) that panics are an indication of bad code, and are things that I would prefer simply ended brutally.

So I had a mull, then called a former colleague - who, like me, was of the view that the rollback should happen within the function body and that deferring it was overly "clever".

So I opted to remove the deferred function altogether and mange rollbacks within the function body. But out of curiosity, I prompted chatGPT with the following prompt

#### My prompt:
"OK this is interesting - I would not have added the check for err in my defer function - To me it seems to obscure the logic - I prefer to handle things like rollback as soon as I see an error, rather than leaving it to be scooped up by a deferred function  - Can you talk me  through the pros and cons?"


#### ChatGPT response:

You're raising a great point about error handling preferences! Let me break down the reasoning behind using a `defer`-based rollback mechanism versus immediate error handling, and then discuss the trade-offs of each approach.

### **Defer-Based Rollback (as in the current code)**

#### **How It Works**
- A `defer` function ensures that the rollback is always attempted, regardless of where or when an error occurs within the function.
- If an error is encountered, the rollback happens at the end of the function.

#### **Pros**
1. **Safety Against Early Returns:**
   - If the function has multiple `return` statements (e.g., early exits on validation or partial success), you won't accidentally forget to handle the rollback.
   - This is particularly useful in functions with complex control flow.

2. **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself):**
   - Rollback logic is written once, reducing duplication compared to handling rollback immediately after every error.

3. **Handles Panics:**
   - If a panic occurs (e.g., nil pointer dereference), the `defer` mechanism ensures cleanup happens before the function exits.

4. **Readability for Main Logic:**
   - The function’s core logic remains clean and focused without repeated rollback handling.

#### **Cons**
1. **Obscures Error Flow:**
   - It separates error handling (rollback) from where the error is detected, which might make the logic harder to follow for someone new to the code.
   - The connection between an error and its corresponding action isn’t explicit.

2. **Potential Overhead:**
   - If rollback is not required (e.g., in a simple case with only one exit point), `defer` adds unnecessary complexity.

---

### **Immediate Rollback Handling**

#### **How It Works**
- Rollback is handled immediately after detecting an error, before returning.

#### **Pros**
1. **Explicit Logic:**
   - The rollback is handled right where the error is detected, making it clear what happens in response to each specific error.
   - Easier to follow for readers and maintainers who prefer linear error handling.

2. **Minimal Overhead:**
   - No additional `defer` logic—rollback is invoked only when needed.

3. **Greater Control:**
   - You can decide to rollback only in specific circumstances, potentially optimizing performance or adding custom rollback logic for specific errors.

#### **Cons**
1. **Risk of Missed Rollback:**
   - If the function has multiple exit points or complex control flow, you might forget to call `tx.Rollback()` in some paths.
   - This is particularly risky if new code is added later.

2. **Repetition:**
   - Rollback logic might need to be repeated in multiple places, leading to duplication and potential inconsistency.

### **Which to Choose?**

#### **When to Use Defer-Based Rollback**
- If your function has **multiple return points** or **complex control flow**, `defer` is safer and ensures rollback isn’t accidentally skipped.
- If you want to guarantee rollback in case of panics, `defer` is essential.

#### **When to Use Immediate Rollback**
- If your function has **simple, linear logic** with one or very few return points, immediate rollback is easier to follow.
- If you want **explicit error handling** at each step for clarity and control.

---

### **A Hybrid Approach**

You can combine the strengths of both by using `defer` for **panic safety** but still rolling back immediately for errors:

```go
func insertBatch(userID, auditID int, batch []responseEntry) error {
	tx, err := db.DB.Begin()
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to start transaction: %w", err)
	}

	defer func() {
		if p := recover(); p != nil {
			_ = tx.Rollback()
			panic(p) // Re-throw the panic
		}
	}()

	// Step 1: Delete records
	questionIDs := []int{}
	for _, e := range batch {
		questionIDs = append(questionIDs, e.questionID)
	}

	deleteQuery := "DELETE FROM responses WHERE audit_id = $1 AND questionID = ANY($2)"
	_, err = tx.Exec(deleteQuery, auditID, pq.Array(questionIDs))
	if err != nil {
		_ = tx.Rollback()
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to delete records: %w", err)
	}

	// Step 2: Insert batch
	placeholders := []string{}
	values := []interface{}{}
	paramIndex := 1
	for _, e := range batch {
		placeholders = append(placeholders, fmt.Sprintf("($%d, $%d, $%d, $%d)", paramIndex, paramIndex+1, paramIndex+2, paramIndex+3))
		values = append(values, userID, auditID, e.questionID, e.response)
		paramIndex += 4
	}

	insertQuery := "INSERT INTO responses (user_id, audit_id, questionID, response) VALUES " + strings.Join(placeholders, ",") + " ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING"
	_, err = tx.Exec(insertQuery, values...)
	if err != nil {
		_ = tx.Rollback()
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to execute batch insert: %w", err)
	}

	// Commit transaction
	if err := tx.Commit(); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to commit transaction: %w", err)
	}

	return nil
}
```

### Final Thoughts

- Choose `defer` if safety and reliability are your top concerns, especially in complex functions.
- Use immediate rollback if you prioritize explicitness and simplicity, especially for straightforward logic.
- A hybrid approach can offer the best of both worlds.
